### Introduction

Our application name is
SYMBIOTE, which actually is divided into two parts, the first which compares the
dataset and another which actually is the user interactive and performs the task given
by the user.


Symbiote- An object detection tool using SSD Module, is a computer technology
related to computer vision and img processing that deals with detecting instances of
semantic objects of a certain class in digital imgs and videos. What makes us different
is that in the same application we are using the same algorithm that can detect imgs
and some features in general. We are using an SSD module to actually detect them.
An SSD is a single-shot detector. It has no delegated region proposal network and
predicts the boundary boxes and the classes directly from feature maps in one single
pass. SSD uses a matching phase while training, to match the appropriate anchor box
with the bounding boxes of each ground truth object within an img. We have designed
it in a way, so that it can detect what a user wants to detect. For example- If a car is
stolen and a user needs to detect its car, he or she can give the details of the car and
the model will give the relevant data which are the same as that the user is looking for.
We have a keen vision that it can be used as a theft-detecting model in the future, with
some sort of modifications in it.

Theft is the most common crime committed across the world. According to the
National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), ~80% of the criminal cases are related to
theft. Increasing theft rates cause people to suffer both financially and emotionally.
Therefore, there is a need to develop a more deterrent surveillance system, which is

convenient to use, free from false alarms, minimizes human interference, and is cost-
effective. Computer vision works on enabling computers to see, identify and process

imgs in the same way that human vision does, and then provide appropriate output. It
is like imparting human intelligence.


Identifying each object in a picture or scene with the help of computer/software is
called object detection. Object detection is an important computer vision task used to
detect instances of visual objects of certain classes (for example, humans, animals,
cars, or buildings) in digital imgs such as photos or video frames. The task of object
detection is to determine whether there are objects belonging to the specified category
in the img. If it exists, then the subsequent task is to identify its category and location
information.In today’s scenario, the fastest algorithm which uses a single layer of
convolutional network to detect the objects from the img is the single shot multibox
detector (SSD) algorithm.

### CORE AREA OF THE PROJECT

WE ARE USING OBJECT DETECTION FOR THEFT DETECTION.

FOR OBJECT DETECTION WE ARE USING SSD ALGORITHM.

1. We will use our Model for surveillance.
2. This surveillance system can be used for theft detection.
3. In this model we will be currently working on theft detection of cars.
4. In the future, We will be working on other things as well by increasing our dataset
and training the model.

What will we be using in our data set to find the car?
1. img of the car
2. Number Plate
3. Color
4. Model of car
5. Year of Manufacturing
6. Any modifications done to the car.

We will Explain our software’s purpose with example:

1. Suppose there is a person Mr. X who has a car and another person Mr. Y who has
stolen Mr. X's Car.
2. Mr X goes to the police to register a complaint against Mr. Y.
3. Now the police has 2 ways to find the car:
a. To look upon the whole CCTV of the nearby areas and find the car.
b. Else use our Symbiote to actually detect where the car actually is.
4. By using our software the police can save a lot of time and get the work to be done
faster.
5. Only Mr. X needs to give details about his car and our software will detect where it
has traveled in the whole city by CCTV footage.

### KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS OUTLINES OF THE SYSTEM
Perpetration is the process that actually yields the smallest- position system
rudiments in the system scale ( system breakdown structure). System
rudiments are made, bought, or reused. Product involves the tackle fabrication
processes of forming, removing, joining, and finishing, the software
consummation processes of rendering and testing, or the functional
procedures development processes for drivers' roles. However, a
manufacturing system which uses the established specialized and operation
processes may be needed, If perpetration involves a product process.
The purpose of the perpetration process is to design and produce (or
fabricate) a system element conforming to that element’s design parcels and/
or conditions. The element is constructed employing applicable technologies
and assiduity practices. This process bridges the system description processes
and the integration process.

### SIGNIFICANT PROJECT OUTCOMES
The significant project outcomes are -
1. Object Detection
2. Theft prevention and theft control
3. Surveillance
4. Object Tracking
5. Identification of objects
For example: Car - Company, Color, Number Plate, etc.

### PROJECT APPLICABILITY ON REAL WORLD
The real world problem deals with the implementation of the many such events that
may occur and will occur. Some of them are stated below:

● Theft Detection
● In malls can be of lost items
6.5 INFERENCE
In this chapter, we came to know about the real world examples of our project along
with the significant outcomes.
