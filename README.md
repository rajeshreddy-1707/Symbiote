### Introduction

Our application name is
SYMBIOTE, which actually is divided into two parts, the first which compares the
dataset and another which actually is the user interactive and performs the task given
by the user.


Symbiote- An SSD Module-based object detection tool is a piece of computer vision and image processing software that finds instances of semantic objects of a particular class in digital images and videos. The fact that we use the same algorithm to recognise photos and other attributes generally inside the same application distinguishes us from other companies. An SSD module is what we're actually employing to find them. A single-shot detector is an SSD. It predicts the border boxes and the classes directly from feature maps in a single pass without the use of a delegated region proposal network.To match the appropriate anchor box with the bounding boxes of each ground truth object within an image, SSD performs a matching phase during training. We built it in such a way that it can recognise what a user wants it to recognise. For instance, if a car is stolen and a user wishes to locate it, he or she can provide the model information and the relevant data will be provided that match what the user is seeking for. With minor adjustments, we have a clear vision of using it as a theft-detection model in the future.

The most frequent type of crime committed worldwide is theft. 80% of criminal cases, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), involve theft. People suffer financially and emotionally when the theft rate rises. Therefore, a more effective monitoring system is required, one that is easy to use, free from false alerts, minimises human involvement, and is also cost-efficient. The goal of computer vision is to give computers the ability to perceive, recognise, and analyse images in a manner similar to that of human vision, and to then produce the desired results. Giving someone human intelligence is like that.

Using a computer and software, object detection identifies every thing in a scene or image. Detecting instances of visual objects of particular classes, such as people, animals, cars, or buildings, in digital images like photo or video frames is a crucial computer vision task. The goal of object detection is to find any things in the image that fit the defined category. The next step is to determine the category and location details if it exists. The single shot multibox detector (SSD) technique is currently the quickest algorithm for object detection from images using a single layer of neural networks.

### CORE AREA OF THE PROJECT

WE ARE USING OBJECT DETECTION FOR THEFT DETECTION.

FOR OBJECT DETECTION WE ARE USING SSD ALGORITHM.

1. We will use our Model for surveillance.
2. This surveillance system can be used for theft detection.
3. In this model we will be currently working on theft detection of cars.
4. In the future, We will be working on other things as well by increasing our dataset
and training the model.

What will we be using in our data set to find the car?
1. img of the car
2. Number Plate
3. Color
4. Model of car
5. Year of Manufacturing
6. Any modifications done to the car.

We will Explain our software’s purpose with example:

1. Suppose there is a person Mr. X who has a car and another person Mr. Y who has
stolen Mr. X's Car.
2. Mr X goes to the police to register a complaint against Mr. Y.
3. Now the police has 2 ways to find the car:
a. To look upon the whole CCTV of the nearby areas and find the car.
b. Else use our Symbiote to actually detect where the car actually is.
4. By using our software the police can save a lot of time and get the work to be done
faster.
5. Only Mr. X needs to give details about his car and our software will detect where it
has traveled in the whole city by CCTV footage.

### KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS OUTLINES OF THE SYSTEM
The system scale's smallest-position system rudiments are actually produced by the repetition process ( system breakdown structure). System foundations are created, purchased, or recycled. Products may include the rendering and testing phases of software, the shaping, removing, connecting, and finishing phases of tackle production, or the functional procedure development phases for driver roles. However, if a product process is involved, a production system that employs the existing specialised and operation processes may be required.
Designing and producing (or fabricating) a system element in accordance with that element's design components and/or conditions is the goal of the perpetration process. The element is built using appropriate technologies and meticulous construction techniques. The integration process and the system description process are connected by this procedure.

### SIGNIFICANT PROJECT OUTCOMES
The significant project outcomes are -
1. Object Detection
2. Theft prevention and theft control
3. Surveillance
4. Object Tracking
5. Identification of objects
For example: Car - Company, Color, Number Plate, etc.

### PROJECT APPLICABILITY ON REAL WORLD
The real world problem deals with the implementation of the many such events that may occur and will occur. Some of them are stated below:

● Theft Detection
● In malls can be of lost items
6.5 INFERENCE
In this chapter, we came to know about the real world examples of our project along
with the significant outcomes.
